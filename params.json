Since Pocket's API to access scraped articles is not publicly available, those URLs are then passed to [Diffbot](http://diffbot.com).\r\n\r\n##How do I use it?\r\nJust `go get github.com/sellweek/pockettxt`, run the program and follow the on-screen instructions.\r\n\r\nIf you want a little bit more control, though, you can use some command-line flags.\r\n\r\n* `-aToken=<token>` bypasses the authentication process and just uses the provided token. Your access token is printed while running pockettxt. It looks something like this: `0123456-789a-bcde-f123-456789`\r\n\r\n* `-filename=<filename>` sets the name of the file which will be written\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
